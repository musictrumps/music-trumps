# trump-engine

Project that could attached to a front-end implementation to build a trumps-like card game.

We are using the Spotify API as a 'database' that returns bands by genre, picture from each artists and number of albums from each band, we are also getting more details using the MusicBrainz API (http://musicbrainz.org).
