# trump-engine

Project that could be attached to a front-end implementation to build a trumps-like card game.

We are using the Spotify API as a 'database' that returns bands/artists by genre and their pictures, we are also getting more details using the MusicBrainz API (http://musicbrainz.org), for example the life span (begin date) of the band or artist.
