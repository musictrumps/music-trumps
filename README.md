# trump-engine

No! Nothing related to Donald Trump, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_(card_games)

Project that could be exported as a Web-API and attached to a front-end implementation to build a trump-like card game.

We are using the Spotify API as a 'database' that returns bands by genre, picture from each artists and number of albums from each band. We are also getting more details using the MusicBrainz API (http://musicbrainz.org).
